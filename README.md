The tasks involve identifying missing wage or employment data for occupations, analyzing annual wage trends to detect anomalies, and verifying whether wages are deflated. Additional samples are taken to uncover patterns in wage anomalies, analyze employment changes for occupations with irregular trends, and map pre-2010 and post-2010 occupation codes using O*NET. Efforts include gathering and mapping wage, employment, population, and GDP data for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), locating and processing shapefiles for MSA boundaries, and coordinating with team members on crosswalk usage. The final step is to consolidate state-level data, including employment, wages, population, and income, into a clean, unified dataframe while ensuring historical consistency as far back as possible.
